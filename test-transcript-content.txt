Date: January 15, 2025
Duration: 45 minutes
Attendees: Adi (Opus), Gabriel (Opus), Sarah Johnson (True North), Mike Chen (True North)

Adi: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining today's discovery call. I'm excited to learn more about True North's needs.

Sarah: Thanks for having us. We're really interested in streamlining our patient intake process. Currently, it takes our staff about 30 minutes per patient.

Mike: Yes, and we're seeing about 50 new patients per week, so this is a significant time investment.

Gabriel: That's definitely something our platform can help with. We've seen other clinics reduce intake time by 60%.

Sarah: That sounds promising. Can you show us a demo of the intake workflow?

Adi: Absolutely. Gabriel, could you schedule a demo for next Tuesday at 2 PM?

Gabriel: I'll send over a calendar invite right after this call.

Mike: What about pricing? We have a budget of around $5,000 per month for software solutions.

Adi: I'll prepare a detailed proposal with our enterprise pricing. Gabriel will send that along with the demo invite.

Sarah: Also, we need to ensure HIPAA compliance. Can you provide documentation?

Gabriel: Yes, I'll include our HIPAA compliance certificate and security documentation in the follow-up email.

Mike: We're also evaluating SimplePractice and TherapyNotes. How do you compare?

Adi: Great question. I'll include a competitive comparison in the proposal highlighting our unique features.

Sarah: This has been very helpful. We need to make a decision by the end of the month.

Adi: Perfect. Let's plan to have the demo on Tuesday, and I'll have the proposal ready by Thursday. Any other questions?

Sarah: No, I think we're good. Looking forward to the demo!
